  - cvccommit: Picture embedding support was improved.
  
  - cvccommit, cvcbulkcommit: The tools now support language filters with
    the -l option, just like cvcexpand does. Option value is sent to cvcexpand
    as-is (passthrough).
  
  - common: All scripts now use getopts to parse options.
  
  - cvccreate: Added options to pass arbitrary constants to the script. Such
    constants are useful when dealing with template substitution, which
    enables automatic inclusion supplied data into newly created CVC files.
    
  - cvcbulkcreate: The tool is now able to extract disc and track numbers from
    file names. This is stil experimental though, and meant to be supplied as
    custom constants to cvccreate.
    
  - cvcbulkcreate, cvcbulkcommit: Calls to find are replaced by bash loops.

  - common: Added file 'config.inc' as a central configuration file common to
    all scripts.
    
  - common: Changed extension of CVC files from .tags to .cvc.
  
  - common: Reserved the .tags file extension to store expanded Vorbis
    Comments in companion files.
    
  - cvcexpand: @INCLUDE directive failed in complex path contexts.
  
  - cvcexpand: Changed item delimiter to "/" when dealing with multiple
    values. This delimiter might be modified by tweaking the
    'CFG_CVCExpand_DefaultDelimiter' configuration parameter.
    
  - cvcexpand: Alias '+FIRSTWORDS' was added to store the first words of a
    vocal work slice.
    
  - cvcexpand: Dynamic track title generator was modified to include the value
    of '+FIRSTWORDS' if no '+WORKSLICETITLE' alias is present.
    
  - cvcexpand: Dynamic track title generator was modified to include a
    placeholder for untitled tracks. This placeholder might be modified by
    tweaking the 'CFG_CVCExpand_UntitledTracks' configuration parameter.

  - cvcexpand: Alias '+LYRICS' was added.
  
  - cvcexpand: Added a feature to show characters once in track titles. Before,
    characters names which were mentioned several times were displayed more
    than once.
  
  - cvccommit: 'cvcupdatetags' was renamed to 'cvccommit'.
  
  - cvccommit: cvccommit now stores expanded CVC files on disk, into .tags
    companion files. Tags in FLAC files are only updated if the modification
    time of the .tags file is newer than the one of the related FLAC file.
    Updates can be forced with the 'force' parameter.
    
  - cvccommit: Added an ignore list to cvccommit to avoid returning an error
    when processing special files, such as 'album.cvc'.
    
  - cvccommit: Added support for embedded album art. Now, cvccommit tries to
    embed album pictures into flac files as part of update operations.
    
  - cvcbulkcommit: 'cvcbulkupdatetags' was renamed to 'cvcbulkcommit'.
  
  - cvccreate: Tool 'cvccreate' was added. This tool creates a CVC companion
    file for a given media file. It may populate the CVC file with content from
    a template file. CVC template files have the extension .cvt, and are located
    by default in the 'templates' directory.
    
  - cvcbulkcreate: Tool 'cvcbulkcreate' was added. It runs cvccreate on all
    media files of a given directory.
